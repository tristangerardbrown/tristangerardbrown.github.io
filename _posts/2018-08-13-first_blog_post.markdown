At Stanford this past winter, I took CS 106AP: Programming Methodology in Python. I really liked it. It was relevant to the GIS work of my doctoral program. As I enjoy learning languages generally, I wanted to learn more. 

Some of my old mentors from college had learned software development and had a great time, so I decided to jump in. It's been a lot of fun so far!
