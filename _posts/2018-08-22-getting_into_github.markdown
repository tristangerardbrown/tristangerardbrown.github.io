GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service that serves as both an essential tool and a social neworking site for programmers. One of it central functions is "forking," which allows a user to copy another user's repository. One can make changes on their computer and then submit a "pull request" to the original owner, who can "merge" the changes with the original repository.
